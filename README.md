# ARStellarEvolution
Description: AR apps that visualize stellar evolution

Highlights and updates so far:

1. The app is done completely in Unity, and I do not have any
   problem exporting it into iOS (haven't tried Android yet).

2. The functionality of the app is complete.

3. Need to add more info about each phase in the life cycle
   of the stars. 

4. Need to make the app looks prettier.

5. Lastly need to redesign the stellar nebula and supernova
   phase in AR.
