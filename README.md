# ARStellarEvolution
Description: AR apps that visualize stellar evolution

For the time being, whenever I put animation on the objects, the AR camera
on my phone will give me a black background as seen in the game mode in Unity.
I am still trying to figure out what causes the black background problem.

I also have problem exporting materials from cycles in blender into Unity. For now,
I just make a simple sphere with diffuse color in blender render.
