# ARStellarEvolution
Description: AR apps that visualize stellar evolution

The src file is the code for Android Studio,
other files are code for Unity.

I have done 3 phases, which is evolution from stellar nebula to red supergiant.
All animations have been done in c# script.
In android studio apps, I added more pictures.

I also export the simple sphere from blender because sphere in Unity is very low resolution.
If you are wondering if this might be the cause of the black background in android studio, 
I have tested using original sphere from unity, it also shows black background.


Problems:

1. Unity project still shows black background in android studio apps, but works fine independently.

2. Do not have any idea how to import material from blender into unity. By the time being, 
I just use particle system in unity.
