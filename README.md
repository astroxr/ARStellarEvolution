# ARStellarEvolution
Description: AR apps that visualize stellar evolution

Highlights and updates so far:

1. The app is done completely in Unity, and I do not have any
   problem exporting it into iOS (haven't tried Android yet).

2. The functionality of the app is complete.

3. Lastly need to redesign supernova phase in AR.
